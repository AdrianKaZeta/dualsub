DualSub
-------
DualSub is a tool to merge SRT subtitles. It allows watch two different subtitles at the same time.

Motivation
----------
The basic idea behind DualSub is to achieve watching **two sets of subtitles at the same time**. *Why can it be useful?* The inspiring use case of DualSub is to watch movies/series in its original version with its original subtitles but also with subtitles in other language. This can be used to learn languages. 

The typical case is watching movies/series in English. If your mother tongue is not English but you want to watch those movies/series, you have several options:

- Learn English
- Watch it with subtitles
- Watch it translated to your mother language
- Do not watch it

DualSub is a tool for those people between options 1 and 2. If your English is not perfect, you usually face to idioms, words and expression you do not know. By watching movies/series with dual subtitles (i.e. its original subtitles plus a translation) you will never be in doubt anymore of those expressions you do not understand, since the translation is instantaneous. All in all, DualSub allows you to learn a second language while you are watching your favorite movie or TV series.
