DualSub \- merge two SRT subtitles into a single file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dualsub
.SH DESCRIPTION
DualSub is a tool which allows you to merge two SRT subtitles in a single file.
The idea of using merged subtitles (let's call them 'dual subtitles') is to watch
movies/series in original version with two sets of subtitles.
Why is this useful? Dual subtitles can be used to learn a second language while
watching movies/series.  The typical case is when your mother tongue is not English
but you want to watch movies/series in English.

Then you have several options:
.br
1. Learn English
.br
2. Watch it with subtitles
.br
3. Watch it translated to your mother language
.br
4. Do not watch it

DualSub is a tool for those people between options 1 and 2. If your English is not perfect,
you usually face to idioms, words and expression you do not know. By watching movies/series
with dual subtitles (i.e. its original subtitles plus a translation) you will never be in
doubt anymore of those expressions you do not understand, since the translation is instantaneous.
